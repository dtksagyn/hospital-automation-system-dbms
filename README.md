Use the cd command followed by the path to your project directory. For example, if your project folder is called "hospital-app" on your desktop, you might type:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/hospital-app
```
4. Install dependencies:

Type npm install and press Enter. This will download all the necessary tools your app needs to run.

5. Start the application:

Make sure you're still in the project folder in your terminal. Then, type node app.js and press Enter. This will launch your hospital appointment system!
